Hey everyone!
Welcome to the project! I'm so excited to start working on this with everyone. Here is the rundown of what you see here.
1. app.py
    - This file is to run the flask backend. By running this file, you will start the backend server. The backend server directly links to the UI and will show you the full app on a web display. During most of your testing, you will work within this server, not even touching the npm stuff. So, you actually don't really need react if your job doesn't include ios and android specific actions.
    - When you run the file, it will give you a link that you can follow that takes you to the development website home page. You change your destination in your browser by adding /"whatever"/ to the url so you can access pages that you are working on.
    - I will mainly work in the app.py file. Most of you will not touch it. Please ask if you believe you need to change something in the app.py file and I will help you work it out.
2. templates folder
    - This is the folder where all of our html will be located. Every screen of our app will have its own html file, so each of you can work on your own separate file following the UI from our design team.
    - If you need help coding in html please look up some simple html tutorials. Also, look at already completed pages for tips.
    - One tip I will say is to ALWAYS use divs with the flex property for positioning. Look this up if you are unsure what it means, but also look up anything else you need.
3. static folder
    - This folder will include all of our javascript and css files. Once again, each webpage will have its own css and js. This means that each of you that are working on a specific page will be working with an html file from templates, and two files in static, the js and the css.
    - Look up simple tutorials on how to design a webpage with css.
    - I already have included model tutorial code so please reference it.
4. StuddyBuddiesApp folder
    - Just don't touch it for now, I will take care of this. We will begin testing on actual ios simulated devices later on.
    - This means that if you are designing UI for the ios or android version, you need to just resize your webpage that you have the project running on to be phone sized.
5. The last thing you need to do if get the firebase config file downloaded as we each need our own. I will send this to everyone and you will add it in the root folder.

*Example files for help and learning how to do this:
- You will find three example files, example.html, example.css, and example.js found in the templates and static folders. You will also find in app.py a function called show example page.
- Please thoroughly read and understand how all of these files work. This is your template for how all of your pages should be built!
- I have included how to pass variables from the backend to the frontend, from the frontend to the backend, passing variables into HTML, and basic HTML and CSS design.
- I have also included basic JS on how to write functions and access stuff from the HTML.
- Please ask me if you have any questions on how these files work. To run and test it, please run the app.py file using python app.py and then change the location to be at whatever the url is plus "/example".

I believe this is everything for you guys to learn how to do this. Again, don't worry about trying to run the npm and react stuff yet. Keep everything on the webpage (don't touch the StudyBuddiesApp folder).

For now please do not edit any files. Just read through everything and let me know any questions you have!
If you do edit anything, just don't commit it to github!

Assignments for what everyone will be working on coming soon!
